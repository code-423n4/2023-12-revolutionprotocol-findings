## Q -01 Secure Vote Counting

**Description:** The vote function may be susceptible to overflow issues, potentially allowing vote manipulation.

**Code Snippet:**

    function vote(uint256 artPieceId, uint256 amount) external {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        artPieces[artPieceId].voteCount += amount;
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
**Updated Code:**

    function vote(uint256 artPieceId, uint256 amount) external {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        uint256 newVoteCount = artPieces[artPieceId].voteCount + amount;
        require(newVoteCount >= artPieces[artPieceId].voteCount, "Vote count overflow");
        artPieces[artPieceId].voteCount = newVoteCount;
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }

**Improvement:** Added overflow checks to the vote counting logic to prevent potential manipulation and ensure the integrity of the voting process.

## -02  Minting Function Guarded Against Zero Address

**Description:** The mint function lacks a check for the zero address, which could lead to tokens being minted to an address that cannot use them.

**Code Snippet:**

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }

**Updated Code:**

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(to != address(0), "Mint to the zero address");
        _mint(to, amount);
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }

**Improvement:** Added a check to prevent minting to the zero address, ensuring that minted tokens are always allocated to a valid address.

## Q -03 Token Purchase Validation

**Description:** The buyToken function does not validate the token amount being purchased, which could result in a failed token purchase without proper feedback.

**Code Snippet:**

    function buyToken() external payable {
        uint256 tokenAmount = calculateTokenAmount(msg.value);
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenAmount);
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
**Updated Code:**

    function buyToken() external payable {
        uint256 tokenAmount = calculateTokenAmount(msg.value);
        require(tokenAmount > 0, "Token amount must be greater than zero");
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenAmount);
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
**Improvement:** Added a check to ensure that the token amount being purchased is greater than zero, providing clear feedback and preventing wasted transactions.

## Q -04 Auction Settlement Validation

**Description:** The settleAuction function may be called before an auction has ended, potentially leading to premature auction closure.

**Code Snippet:**

    function settleAuction() external {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        require(auctionEnd < block.timestamp, "Auction not yet ended");
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
**Updated Code:**

    function settleAuction() external {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        require(auctionEnd <= block.timestamp, "Auction not yet ended");
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
**Improvement:** Corrected the condition to ensure that the auction can only be settled after the specified end time, preventing premature settlement.

## Q -05 Minting Guard Against Invalid Art Piece ID

**Description:** The mintArtPiece function lacks validation for the art piece ID, which could result in minting a token for a non-existent art piece.

**Code Snippet:**

    function mintArtPiece(address to, uint256 artPieceId) external onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, artPieceId);
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
**Updated Code:**

    function mintArtPiece(address to, uint256 artPieceId) external onlyOwner {
        require(artPieceExists(artPieceId), "Art piece does not exist");
        _mint(to, artPieceId);
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
**Improvement:** Added a check to ensure that the art piece ID is valid before minting, ensuring that only existing art pieces are represented by tokens.

## Q -06 Dynamic Pricing Adjustment

**Description:** The pricing function may not properly adjust the token price according to the emission schedule, potentially leading to incorrect pricing.

**Code Snippet:**

    function price() public view returns (uint256) {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        return currentPrice;
    }
**Updated Code:**

    function price() public view returns (uint256) {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        uint256 adjustedPrice = calculatePriceAdjustment(currentPrice);
        return adjustedPrice;
    }
**Improvement:** Implemented a dynamic pricing adjustment based on the emission schedule to ensure that the token price accurately reflects the intended issuance rate.

## Q-07  Accurate Reward Calculation

**Description:** The reward calculation may not account for all scenarios, potentially leading to incorrect reward distributions.

**Code Snippet:**

    function computeRewards(uint256 totalAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        return totalAmount * rewardRate / 100;
    }
**Updated Code:**

    function computeRewards(uint256 totalAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        uint256 rewards = totalAmount * rewardRate / 100;
        require(rewards <= totalAmount, "Rewards exceed total amount");
        return rewards;
    }
**Improvement:** Added checks to ensure that the calculated rewards do not exceed the total amount available, preventing over-distribution of rewards.

## Q -08 Fair Reward Splitting

**Description:** The reward splitting logic may not evenly distribute rewards among stakeholders, leading to potential discrepancies.

**Code Snippet:**

    function computeSplit(uint256 totalRewards) public view returns (uint256) {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        return totalRewards / stakeholders.length;
    }
**Updated Code:**

    function computeSplit(uint256 totalRewards) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
        // ... omitted for brevity ...
        uint256[] memory splits = new uint256[](stakeholders.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakeholders.length; i++) {
            splits[i] = totalRewards * stakeholderShares[i] / totalShares;
        }
        return splits;
    }
**Improvement:** Implemented a more equitable reward splitting mechanism that accounts for each stakeholder's share, ensuring fair distribution based on predefined rules.
