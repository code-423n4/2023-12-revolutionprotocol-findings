# Overview

Revolution is a set of contracts that improve on <ins>Nouns DAO</ins>. Nouns is a generative avatar collective that auctions off one ERC721, every day, forever. 100% of the proceeds of each auction (the winning bid) go into a shared treasury, and owning an NFT gets you 1 vote over the treasury.

The ultimate goal of Revolution is fair ownership distribution over a community movement where anyone can earn decision making power over the energy of the movement. If this excites you, <ins>build with us</ins>.
