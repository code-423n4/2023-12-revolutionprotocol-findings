If verbId = _currentVerbId is passed into the following function it would be an invalid piece id because for  _currentVerbId there is no art peice in the artPieces mapping so the require function should be changed from <= to <.

```function getArtPieceById(uint256 verbId) public view returns (ICultureIndex.ArtPiece memory) {
        require(verbId <= _currentVerbId, "Invalid piece ID");
        return artPieces[verbId];
    }
```

Currently an auction can go on until there is no new bidder and the block timestamp has reached auction end time but auction for a art piece can go on for undecided amount of time as the auction end time can be extended if a new bidder arises before the auction end time, then auction end time is increased using timeBuffer variable it can lead to a lot of waiting time period for other art piece who have reached quorum votes and are ready to be auctioned. So i suggest a fixed auction time.
```
   bool extended = _auction.endTime - block.timestamp < timeBuffer;
        if (extended) auction.endTime = _auction.endTime = block.timestamp + timeBuffer;
```
