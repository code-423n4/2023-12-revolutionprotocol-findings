## [QA-1]  Missing 0 Address Check in Initial Owner Initialization
The contract's initialization functions appears to set the `initialOwner` variable using the provided `_initialOwner` argument. However, it lacks a crucial check to ensure that the assigned value is not the invalid address of 0.
If the `initialOwner` is inadvertently set to `0`, control over critical contract functions and assets might be lost prompting a redeployment which is expensive.

## [QA-2] Missing Import Statement for Initializable in the Contract's Initialize Function
 All contracts are  attempting to use an `initializer` modifier in its `initialize` function without correctly importing and utilizing the `Initializable` contract from OpenZeppelin. This indicates a potential error in the contract's design and implementation.

Add the following import statement to the contract:

`import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol"`

Inherit from the Initializable contract:   `
``````
contract MyContract is Initializable {
    // ... contract code
}
