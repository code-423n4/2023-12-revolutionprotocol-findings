## **Gas Limit:** The gas limit of 50,000 might be too low for certain scenarios, and the transfer could fail if the execution requires more gas.

&nbsp;

Imagine your contract has a more complex fallback function that involves multiple external calls, storage operations, or computations. Let's say that under normal circumstances, the fallback function requires around 70,000 gas to execute successfully.

Now, a user sends a transaction to trigger this fallback function with the gas limit set to 50,000. As a result, the fallback function won't have enough gas to complete its execution, leading to an out-of-gas error and a failed transaction.

In this scenario, the gas limit is too low for the actual requirements of the fallback function, causing transactions to fail when interacting with it. Adjusting the gas limit to a higher value that accommodates the actual gas needs of the function would be necessary for successful execution in this case.

```
function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address _to, uint256 _amount) private {
        // Ensure the contract has enough ETH to transfer
        if (address(this).balance < _amount) revert("Insufficient balance");


        // Used to store if the transfer succeeded
        bool success;


        assembly {
            // Transfer ETH to the recipient
            // Limit the call to 50,000 gas
            success := call(50000, _to, _amount, 0, 0, 0, 0)
        }


        // If the transfer failed:
        if (!success) {
            // Wrap as WETH
            IWETH(WETH).deposit{ value: _amount }();


            // Transfer WETH instead
            bool wethSuccess = IWETH(WETH).transfer(_to, _amount);


            // Ensure successful transfer
            if (!wethSuccess) revert("WETH transfer failed");
        }
```
