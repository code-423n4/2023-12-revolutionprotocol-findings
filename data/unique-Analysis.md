# the Revolution protocol

Revolution is a set of contracts that improve on <ins>Nouns DAO</ins>. Nouns is a generative avatar collective that auctions off one ERC721, every day, forever. 100% of the proceeds of each auction (the winning bid) go into a shared treasury, and owning an NFT gets you 1 vote over the treasury.

Compared to Nouns, Revolution seeks to make governance token ownership more accessible to creators and builders, and balance the scales between culture and capital while committing to a constant governance inflation schedule.

The ultimate goal of Revolution is fair ownership distribution over a community movement where anyone can earn decision making power over the energy of the movement. If this excites you, <ins>build with us</ins>.

# Audit approach

1.  Read the README.md
    
2.  Try to understand how the system works
    
3.  Look at the  <ins>Nouns DAO</ins>   repo to get a better idea of the Revolution protocol.

4.  Look at each code individually.
    
5.  Write a Report by compiling all the insights I gained throughout the line-by-line code review.
    

# Contracts

## 1\. MaxHeap.sol

- **Functionality:**
    
    - Implements a max-heap data structure with standard operations like insertion, updating values, and extracting the maximum element.
    - Designed to be upgradeable using the UUPS pattern.
    - Utilizes OpenZeppelin's `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` and `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` for ownership and reentrancy protection.
- **Security Considerations:**
    
    - Implements various OpenZeppelin contracts for security.
    - Uses `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` for ownership control with a two-step process.
    - Implements reentrancy protection with `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`.
    - The `_authorizeUpgrade` function ensures that only the owner can authorize an upgrade.
- **Initialization and Upgradeability:**
    
    - The `constructor` is marked as `payable` and `initializer`, which is unconventional and should be reviewed for correctness.
    - The `initialize` function sets up the contract state for upgradeable functionality, but it should be protected to ensure it's called only once.
    - Uses the UUPS pattern for upgradeability with version management.
- **Heap Operations:**
    
    - Implements standard heap operations such as insertion, updating values, and extracting the maximum element.
    - The `maxHeapify` function assumes the existence of left and right child nodes without proper bounds checking, posing a risk of out-of-bounds access.
- **Access Controls:**
    
    - The `onlyAdmin` modifier is used for functions like `insert`, `updateValue`, and `extractMax`, which might be intentional for separation of roles. However, this means that the owner does not have direct control over these operations unless they are also the admin.
- **Potential Flaws and Improvements:**
    
    - The `constructor` being marked as `initializer` could be unconventional and should be carefully reviewed for correctness.
    - The `maxHeapify` function should include bounds checking for left and right child nodes to prevent out-of-bounds access.
    - Consider implementing functions to remove or decrease the value of an item in the heap for a more complete heap implementation.
    - The contract does not limit the size of the heap, which might be a concern for potential out-of-gas errors.
- **Overall Impression:**
    
    - A well-structured contract for managing a max-heap data structure with upgradeability and security features. Pay attention to initialization, access controls, and bounds checking for secure heap operations.
