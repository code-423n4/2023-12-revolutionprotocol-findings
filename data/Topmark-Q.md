### Report 1:
#### Unnecessary code complexities
As edited below one of the condition statement in the _vote(...) function uses "!" operator twice in other to ensure only address that has not voted before are allowed to vote, instead of using two negatives, they can simply cancel out each other, "==" operator should be used as it makes the code more readable and direct

```solidity
 function _vote(uint256 pieceId, address voter) internal {
        require(pieceId < _currentPieceId, "Invalid piece ID");
        require(voter != address(0), "Invalid voter address");
        require(!pieces[pieceId].isDropped, "Piece has already been dropped");
---        require(!(votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress != address(0)), "Already voted");
+++        require( votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress == address(0 ), "Already voted");
 ...
```
### Report 2:
#### Incomplete Code Implementation
As noted in the code below necessary security considerations should be added based on block created to prevent flash attacks.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution/src/CultureIndex.sol#L321
```solidity
function _vote(uint256 pieceId, address voter) internal {
        require(pieceId < _currentPieceId, "Invalid piece ID");
        require(voter != address(0), "Invalid voter address");
        require(!pieces[pieceId].isDropped, "Piece has already been dropped");
        require(!(votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress != address(0)), "Already voted");

        uint256 weight = _getPastVotes(voter, pieces[pieceId].creationBlock);
        require(weight > minVoteWeight, "Weight must be greater than minVoteWeight");

        votes[pieceId][voter] = Vote(voter, weight);
        totalVoteWeights[pieceId] += weight;

        uint256 totalWeight = totalVoteWeights[pieceId];

>>>        // TODO add security consideration here based on block created to prevent flash attacks on drops?
        maxHeap.updateValue(pieceId, totalWeight);
        emit VoteCast(pieceId, voter, weight, totalWeight);
    }
```
