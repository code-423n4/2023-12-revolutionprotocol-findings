 function _vote(uint256 pieceId, address voter) internal {
        require(pieceId < _currentPieceId, "Invalid piece ID");
        require(voter != address(0), "Invalid voter address");
        require(!pieces[pieceId].isDropped, "Piece has already been dropped");
---        require(!(votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress != address(0)), "Already voted");
+++        require( votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress == address(0 ), "Already voted");
