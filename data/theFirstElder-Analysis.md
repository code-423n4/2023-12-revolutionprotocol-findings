## Introduction

This report presents the results of our audit of the ``Revolution Protocol. Our aim was to evaluate the contract's code-base, identify any centralization risks, and provide architectural recommendations.

## Comments for the Judge

Our findings are presented in the following sections. We believe these insights will help the judge understand the context of our evaluation.

## Approach Taken in Evaluating the Code-base

We approached the evaluation of the code-base by focusing on the main functions of the Protocol, which is the Auction House contract. Before testing for security vulnerabilities, we attempted to find bugs within the protocol. The code-base is well-written with adequate documentation and proper nomenclature of variables.

## Architecture Recommendations

Given the well-structured nature of the code-base, we do not see a need for significant architectural changes at this time. However, we recommend maintaining good coding practices and ensuring regular code reviews to catch any potential issues early.

## Codebase Quality Analysis

The Code-base is well-written with adequate documentation and proper nomenclature of variables. This makes it easier to understand the functionality of the contract and reduces the risk of errors.

## Centralization Risks

We identified a centralization risk related to the trusted owners of the contract. The contract has owners with privileged rights to perform administrative tasks. These owners need to be trusted to avoid performing malicious updates or draining funds. To mitigate this risk, we recommend implementing strict access controls and regularly auditing the actions of privileged accounts.

## Mechanism Review

Our review of the mechanisms used in the contract revealed that they are well-designed and secure. However, due to the centralization risk, we recommend implementing additional safeguards to protect against potential misuse of privileged rights.

## Systemic Risks

During our audit, we identified a potential systemic risk related to cross-function attacks. Cross-function attacks occur when a malicious actor gains control of multiple functions within a system, allowing them to manipulate the system's behavior in unintended ways.

In the context of the Auction House contract, a cross-function attack could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the auction process, and casing havoc such as DOS attacks.

To mitigate this risk, we recommend implementing robust access controls and monitoring systems. Access controls should restrict the ability of any single account to perform multiple functions simultaneously. Monitoring systems should track unusual activity and alert administrators if suspicious behavior is detected.

Furthermore, we recommend conducting regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. These measures can help ensure the integrity and security of the protocol.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Revolution Protocol contract appears to be well-written and secure. However, the centralization risk poses a potential threat. We recommend implementing strict access controls and regular audits to mitigate this risk.
