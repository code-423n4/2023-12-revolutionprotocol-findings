### [N-01] Unnecessary double negation in require check

**Description:**
In the `CultureIndex::_vote()` function, there's a validation to ensure that the voter has not already participated. This is achieved by inspecting the voter's address through `votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress` and verifying it against `address(0)`. The condition checks for the inequality of the voter's address with `address(0)` and is expressed with the negation operator, ensuring that the voter has not previously cast a vote.

This can be simplified to:
```javascript
require(votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress == address(0), "Already voted");
```

**Code:**
```javascript
function _vote(uint256 pieceId, address voter) internal {
    require(pieceId < _currentPieceId, "Invalid piece ID");
    require(voter != address(0), "Invalid voter address");
    require(!pieces[pieceId].isDropped, "Piece has already been dropped");
@>  require(!(votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress != address(0)), "Already voted");  // @audit double NE ?

    uint256 weight = _getPastVotes(voter, pieces[pieceId].creationBlock);
    require(weight > minVoteWeight, "Weight must be greater than minVoteWeight");

    votes[pieceId][voter] = Vote(voter, weight);
    totalVoteWeights[pieceId] += weight;

    uint256 totalWeight = totalVoteWeights[pieceId];

    // TODO add security consideration here based on block created to prevent flash attacks on drops?
    maxHeap.updateValue(pieceId, totalWeight);
    emit VoteCast(pieceId, voter, weight, totalWeight);
}
```

**Recomended Mitigation:**
```diff
function _vote(uint256 pieceId, address voter) internal {
    require(pieceId < _currentPieceId, "Invalid piece ID");
    require(voter != address(0), "Invalid voter address");
    require(!pieces[pieceId].isDropped, "Piece has already been dropped");
-   require(!(votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress != address(0)), "Already voted");
+   require(votes[pieceId][voter].voterAddress == address(0), "Already voted");

    uint256 weight = _getPastVotes(voter, pieces[pieceId].creationBlock);
    require(weight > minVoteWeight, "Weight must be greater than minVoteWeight");
    ...
}
```
